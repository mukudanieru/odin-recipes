# odin-recipes

This project, **odin-recipes**, is part of the foundational projects offered by **The Odin Project**. It serves as an introduction to working with basic HTML elements to create a simple website showcasing a few recipes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a basic HTML page that links to several recipe pages. Each recipe will display essential details such as ingredients, steps, and images.

## Skills Learned

Throughout the project, Iâ€™ve learned and practiced the following HTML concepts:

- **Elements and Tags**
- **HTML Boilerplate**
- **Working with Text**
- **Lists**
- **Links and Images**

## Next Steps

As I continue with **The Odin Project**, I will apply more complex concepts and CSS to improve the layout and style of this basic website.

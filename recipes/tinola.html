    <p>
      <strong>Tinola</strong> is a nourishing Filipino chicken soup that
      features a fragrant broth, made by simmering chicken with <br />ginger,
      garlic, and onion. Traditionally, green papaya or chayote and chili leaves
      are added, giving the soup<br />
      its fresh and slightly sweet flavor. Tinola is a light, comforting dish
      that's perfect for cold days or when you're<br />
      craving something simple and satisfying. It's commonly served with steamed
      rice, making it a staple in Filipino households.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Sauté Aromatics</h4>
        In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium heat. Add
        the chopped onions, garlic,<br />
        and ginger. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onions are softened and the
        mixture is fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add the Chicken</h4>
        Add the chicken pieces to the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, until the chicken begins to<br />
        brown slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add Water and Chicken Cubes</h4>
        Pour in 6 cups of water and add the Knorr chicken cubes. Stir well to
        dissolve the cubes, and bring<br />
        the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover, and
        cook for 25-30 minutes,<br />
        or until the chicken is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add Chayote or Papaya</h4>
        Add the sliced chayote or green papaya to the pot. Continue to simmer
        for another 10-12 minutes until the vegetable is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add Moringa Leaves</h4>
        Add the moringa leaves, stirring gently. Cook for an additional 1-2
        minutes until the leaves are wilted but still bright green.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Season and Serve</h4>
        Season the soup with salt to taste. Serve hot with steamed rice for a
        comforting, nourishing meal.

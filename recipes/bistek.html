      <p>
        <strong>Bistek</strong>, or Filipino Beef Steak, is a deliciously hearty
        dish featuring thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce and calamansi
        (or lemon) juice, then pan-fried and topped with caramelized onions.
        This simple yet flavorful dish combines a blend of salty, sour, and
        slightly sweet flavors, with tender beef slices and onions that add
        depth and texture. Best enjoyed with rice, Bistek is a Filipino favorite
        known for its rich taste and straightforward preparation.

        </li>
        <li>8 tablespoons of kalamansi juice</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>&frac12; tablespoon of freshly-ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 to 4 garlic gloves (minced)</li>
        <li>1 and &frac12; large (white) onions, cut into rings</li>
        <li>1 small red onions</li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons of neutral oil (whatever you and your family prefers)

      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Marinate the Beef</h4>
          In a large bowl, combine the beef slices, kalamansi juice, soy sauce,
          freshly ground pepper, and half of the minced garlic. Mix well to coat
          the beef evenly, then let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to
          absorb the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Sauté the Red Onions</h4>
          Slice the red onion thinly and set aside the white onions, which will
          be used later. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil
          over medium heat. Add the sliced red onions, cooking until soft and
          slightly caramelized (about 3-4 minutes). Remove the onions from the
          skillet and set them aside.

        <li>
          <h4>Sauté the Red Onions</h4>
          Slice the red onion thinly and set aside the white onions, which will
          be used later. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil
          over medium heat. Add the sliced red onions, cooking until soft and
          slightly caramelized (about 3-4 minutes). Remove the onions from the
          skillet and set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Brown the Beef</h4>
          In the same skillet, add the marinated beef slices in a single layer.
          Brown each side for about 1-2 minutes until the beef develops a nice
          color. Work in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add the Sauce</h4>
          Pour the remaining marinade into the skillet with the beef. Add 1 to 2
          cups of water based on your preferred sauce consistency and strength.
          Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10-15
          minutes, or until the beef is tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add White Onions and Simmer</h4>
          Slice the white onions into rings, then add them to the skillet in the
          last 2-3 minutes of cooking. This allows the white onions to soften
          slightly without losing their texture or bite.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Serve</h4>
          Transfer the beef to a serving plate, topping with the sauce, red
          onions, and softened white onion rings. Serve with steamed rice and
          enjoy!

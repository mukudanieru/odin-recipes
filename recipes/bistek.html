    <p>
      <strong>Bistek</strong>, or Filipino Beef Steak, is a deliciously hearty
      dish featuring thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce <br />and
      calamansi (or lemon) juice, then pan-fried and topped with caramelized
      onions. This simple yet flavorful <br />dish combines a blend of salty,
      sour, and slightly sweet flavors, with tender beef slices and onions that
      add <br />depth and texture. Best enjoyed with rice, Bistek is a Filipino
      favorite known for its rich taste and <br />straightforward preparation.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb beef sirloin or 1 lb beef tenderloin, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons of kalamansi juice</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>&frac12; tablespoon of freshly-ground pepper</li>
      <li>3 to 4 garlic gloves (minced)</li>
      <li>1 and &frac12; large (white) onions, cut into rings</li>
      <li>1 small red onions</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons of neutral oil (whatever you and your family prefers)
      </li>
      <li>1 to 2 cups of water (depends on your preference of taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Marinate the Beef</h4>
        In a large bowl, combine the beef slices, kalamansi juice, soy sauce,
        freshly ground pepper, and half<br />
        of the minced garlic. Mix well to coat the beef evenly, then let it
        marinate for at least 30 minutes to<br />
        absorb the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Sauté the Red Onions</h4>
        Slice the red onion thinly and set aside the white onions, which will be
        used later. In a large skillet,<br />
        heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over medium heat. Add the sliced red
        onions, cooking until soft<br />
        and slightly caramelized (about 3-4 minutes). Remove the onions from the
        skillet and set them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Sauté the Red Onions</h4>
        Slice the red onion thinly and set aside the white onions, which will be
        used later. In a large skillet,<br />
        heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over medium heat. Add the sliced red
        onions, cooking until soft<br />
        and slightly caramelized (about 3-4 minutes). Remove the onions from the
        skillet and set them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Brown the Beef</h4>
        In the same skillet, add the marinated beef slices in a single layer.
        Brown each side for about 1-2<br />
        minutes until the beef develops a nice color. Work in batches if needed
        to avoid overcrowding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add the Sauce</h4>
        Pour the remaining marinade into the skillet with the beef. Add 1 to 2
        cups of water based on your<br />
        preferred sauce consistency and strength. Bring to a boil, then reduce
        the heat and let it simmer<br />
        for 10-15 minutes, or until the beef is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add White Onions and Simmer</h4>
        Slice the white onions into rings, then add them to the skillet in the
        last 2-3 minutes of cooking.<br />
        This allows the white onions to soften slightly without losing their
        texture or bite.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Serve</h4>
        Transfer the beef to a serving plate, topping with the sauce, red
        onions, and softened white onion rings.<br />
        Serve with steamed rice and enjoy!

      <p>
        <strong>Sinigang</strong> is a popular Filipino soup known for its
        distinct sour and savory flavor. Made with pork, beef, or seafood, and
        simmered with a variety of vegetables like radish, tomatoes, and leafy
        greens, Sinigang gets its signature tang from tamarind or other souring
        agents like green mango or calamansi. Served piping hot, it's a
        comforting dish that pairs wonderfully with rice and is enjoyed for its
        refreshing and uniquely Filipino taste.

        <li>2 pcs siling pangsigang</li>
        <li>1 (20g) pack of Sinigang Mix (depends on your preference)</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Clean and Boil the Pork</h4>
          Rinse the pork spare ribs thoroughly under running water to remove any
          impurities. In a large pot, add the pork and pour in 4 Â¼ cups of
          water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower the heat and
          simmer for 30-40 minutes, skimming off any scum that rises to the
          surface for a clear broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add Aromatics and Simmer</h4>
          Add the quartered red onion and tomatoes to the pot. Cover and let
          simmer for an additional 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld
          together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add Root Vegetables and Seasoning</h4>
          Add the sliced labanos and okra to the pot. Pour in the Sinigang Mix,
          adjusting the amount based on your preferred level of sourness. Stir
          well and continue to cook for 10 more minutes until the root
          vegetables start to soften.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add Remaining Vegetables</h4>
          Add the sliced talong and sitaw, then simmer for another 5-7 minutes
          until the vegetables are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Finish with Greens and Chili</h4>
          Add the kangkong stalks first, followed by the leaves, and the siling
          pangsigang. Stir gently and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until
          the greens are just wilted but still vibrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Serve</h4>
          Ladle the hot, sour sinigang into bowls and serve with steamed rice.
          Enjoy this comforting and tangy Filipino favorite!

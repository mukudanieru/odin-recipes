    <p>
      <strong>Sinigang</strong> is a popular Filipino soup known for its
      distinct sour and savory flavor. Made with pork, beef, or seafood,<br />
      and simmered with a variety of vegetables like radish, tomatoes, and leafy
      greens, Sinigang gets its signature tang <br />from tamarind or other
      souring agents like green mango or calamansi. Served piping hot, it's a
      comforting dish that<br />
      pairs wonderfully with rice and is enjoyed for its refreshing and uniquely
      Filipino taste.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Clean and Boil the Pork</h4>
        Rinse the pork spare ribs thoroughly under running water to remove any
        impurities. In a large pot, add the pork<br />
        and pour in 4 Â¼ cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then
        lower the heat and simmer for<br />
        30-40 minutes, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface for a
        clear broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add Aromatics and Simmer</h4>
        Add the quartered red onion and tomatoes to the pot. Cover and let
        simmer for an additional 10 minutes,<br />
        allowing the flavors to meld together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add Root Vegetables and Seasoning</h4>
        Add the sliced labanos and okra to the pot. Pour in the Sinigang Mix,
        adjusting the amount based on your preferred level<br />
        of sourness. Stir well and continue to cook for 10 more minutes until
        the root vegetables start to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add Remaining Vegetables</h4>
        Add the sliced talong and sitaw, then simmer for another 5-7 minutes
        until the vegetables are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Finish with Greens and Chili</h4>
        Add the kangkong stalks first, followed by the leaves, and the siling
        pangsigang.<br />
        Stir gently and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the greens are
        just wilted but still vibrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Serve</h4>
        Ladle the hot, sour sinigang into bowls and serve with steamed rice.
        Enjoy this comforting and tangy Filipino favorite!

    <p>
      A beloved Filipino classic, <strong>Adobo</strong> is a savory and tangy
      dish made by simmering meat, usually chicken or pork, in a marinade of soy
      <br />
      sauce, vinegar, garlic, and black pepper. This slow-cooked stew absorbs
      rich flavors, creating a tender and flavorful dish with a perfect balance
      <br />
      of salty, sour, and umami notes. Often served with steamed rice, adobo is
      a comforting meal with a unique, bold taste that has earned it a place in
      <br />
      Filipino culinary tradition.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Marinate the chicken</h4>
        In a large bowl, put the chicken pieces with soy sauce, vinegar, and
        half of the minced garlic. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1
        day <br />
        in the refrigerator, turning occasionally to ensure even flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Prepare the pan</h4>
        In a pan or deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over
        medium-high heat. Add the remaining garlic and sliced onions, saut√©ing
        until <br />
        fragrant and the onions become translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Brown the chicken</h4>
        Add the marinated chicken pieces to pot, reserving the marinade. Brown
        the chicken on each side for about 2-3 minutes until they develop <br />
        a nice golden color.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Simmer with Marinade and Spices</h4>
        Pour the reserved marinade over the chicken. Add the whole black
        peppercorns, bay leaves, and 1 to 2 cups of water, depending on your
        <br />
        desired flavor intensity and sauce consistency. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Add the potatoes</h4>
        Add the chopped potatoes to the pot, making sure they're submerged in
        the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer.
        <br />
        Cover and cook for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and
        cooked through and the potatoes are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Adjust Seasoning</h4>
        Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding a bit more
        soy sauce or vinegar to achieve your preferred balance of salty and
        tangy flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 style="margin: 5px">Serve</h4>
        Serve the chicken adobo with steamed rice, and garnish with extra sauce
        from the pot. Enjoy the rich, savory flavors of this Filipino classic!

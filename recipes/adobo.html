      <p>
        A beloved Filipino classic, <strong>Adobo</strong> is a savory and tangy
        dish made by simmering meat, usually chicken or pork, in a marinade of
        soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and black pepper. This slow-cooked stew
        absorbs rich flavors, creating a tender and flavorful dish with a
        perfect balance of salty, sour, and umami notes. Often served with
        steamed rice, adobo is a comforting meal with a unique, bold taste that
        has earned it a place in Filipino culinary tradition.

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Marinate the chicken</h4>
          In a large bowl, put the chicken pieces with soy sauce, vinegar, and
          half of the minced garlic. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1
          day in the refrigerator, turning occasionally to ensure even flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Prepare the pan</h4>
          In a pan or deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over
          medium-high heat. Add the remaining garlic and sliced onions, saut√©ing
          until fragrant and the onions become translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Brown the chicken</h4>
          Add the marinated chicken pieces to pot, reserving the marinade. Brown
          the chicken on each side for about 2-3 minutes until they develop a
          nice golden color.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Simmer with Marinade and Spices</h4>
          Pour the reserved marinade over the chicken. Add the whole black
          peppercorns, bay leaves, and 1 to 2 cups of water, depending on your
          desired flavor intensity and sauce consistency. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Add the potatoes</h4>
          Add the chopped potatoes to the pot, making sure they're submerged in
          the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer.
          Cover and cook for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and
          cooked through and the potatoes are soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Adjust Seasoning</h4>
          Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding a bit
          more soy sauce or vinegar to achieve your preferred balance of salty
          and tangy flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Serve</h4>
          Serve the chicken adobo with steamed rice, and garnish with extra
          sauce from the pot. Enjoy the rich, savory flavors of this Filipino
          classic!
